# Gravity Simulation

This is a small python script made with **pygame-ce** to simulate Newton gravity
Its being developed and tested in python 3.13.1 (the at the time newest release of python)
I dont know how the backwards compatibily is, but since this is a basic program, i try to use standard stuff
I think python 3.6 should also work on this aswell.
I use pygame-ce, but the code only uses native pygame keywords, so you should also be able to use a old version of pygame

It only supports Circles, at least as of now.

## Controls

| button             | action            |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Space              | pause / unpause   |
| R                  | reset velocity    |
| Mouse Left         | change position   |
| Mouse Right        | change velocity   |
| Mouse Left + Right | change radius     |
| Wheel Click        | add / remove ball |
| ctrl               | snap to grid      |

## Hud

The buttons on top left indicate some extra info to draw

The slider bottom left is used for dt / simulation speed

The one above controls the trajectory length

The number top right is the amount of balls

## TODO

Seperate world and screen space

Add camera object

Draw circles that partly out of screen correctly

Make grid size changeable

Trajectory paths should start at the edge of the screen

Physics update: use runge kutta order 4 integration

Fix bug where the balls go haywire when constantly touhing
