# Gravity Simulation

This is a small python script made with **pygame-ce** to simulate Newton gravity

It only supports Circles, at least as of now.

## Controls

**Space** to pause / unpause

**Mouse Left** to drag the balls arround

**Mouse Right** to change velocity

**Wheel Click** add / remove ball

**LMB + RMB** change radius

**CTRL** snaps to grid (position and velocity)

### Hud
The buttons on top left indicate some extra info to draw

The slider bottom left is used for dt / simulation speed

## TODO

Seperate world and screen space

Add camera object

Draw background grid
